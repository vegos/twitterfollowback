Script for populating a database with twitter followers.

The script gets a list of the followers, then checks if they are friends
and creates friendship.
It also sends a direct message (and destroy/delete it after that).

Make a crontab entry to run twice a day (twitter API has limitations on
requests) and every user that follows you will be followed back automatically.


Replace <username> with your twitter username & <message to send> with your
custom message on getfollowers.py and the secrets/keys on config.py.
